Why are we doing this? 
Interacting with databases is one of the most common business cases for writing applications.
Therefore it is important to understand how to program a database and interact with it using SQL and C#.

How I expected the challenge to go. 
I felt I understood what was being asked so I expected it to go well.

What went well? 
I think the displaying of the tables is quite clean for a terminal application

What didn't go as planned? 
This project went as planned as I felt I understood what was being asked

Possible improvements for future
Develop a GUI for better user interaction
